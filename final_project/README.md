# Project Identify Fraud from Enron Email

## Project Overview

In 2000, Enron was one of the largest companies in the United States. By 2002, it had collapsed into bankruptcy due to widespread corporate fraud. In the resulting Federal investigation, a significant amount of typically confidential information entered into the public record, including tens of thousands of emails and detailed financial data for top executives. In this project, I built a person of interest (POI) identifier based on financial and email data made public as a result of the Enron scandal. This data was combined with a hand-generated list of POI in the fraud case.

## Project question and dataset 

##### Goal of the project
The goal of the project is to determine who is a POI based on financial and email data made public.
Machine learning can be useful by classifying persons based on the financial and email data into a POI group and a non-POI group.
For this purpose, POI were identified based on the fact if they were indicted, reached a settlement or plea deal or testified in exchange for prosecution immunity

3) Explain dataset: background dataset, how can it be used to answer the question, outliers in the data, how were outliers handled
